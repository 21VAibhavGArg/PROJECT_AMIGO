AMIGO is a healthcare gamification app to support and empower children suffering from chronic disesases for instance type-I diabetes, a number which is constantly incresing;therapy is often troublesome and a big challenge for both children and parents;Managingday­to­day life with diabetes includes estimating carbs, analyzing blood glucose levels as well as calculating the correct insulin dose. Many children often need their parents’ help since this is a very difficult task to cope with.

In order to manage diabetes and other such disesases AMIGO aims to help children to deal with their diseases in a playful way
and succesfully master day­to­day life with their often troublesome and complicated therapy and routine.

AMIGO aims to achieve this by gamificaation of the process of following routine by leveraging childrens' connect with technology by creating a virtual companion within the app.

The little ones are enabled to be more independent and get support from their parents even when they are not around, while
parents can always keep track of their children’s therapy. Furthermore, the young ones get rewarded not only with educational feedback ftheir virtual friend; thus the child connects with the virtual character;The purpose of this gamified app approach is to help children adopt new habits in the form of fun and exciting quests!

    Internal currency/rewards/Badges. For each completed task, the users get different rewards: AMIGOP, HP, and gold/Badges.
    Competition. The children can compete with others in challenges to fight the diseases.
    Learning. After the users complete tasks, they can learn new concepts.
